Data collection methodology: Added in the End Note of my website. You can check the original collecting sheet here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wpRslQrRukFWBSqI57CLkCymWZaO91JTqoxBDAPDzg8/edit?usp=sharing
## The Process

I visualize the data in this way because I want my user to see clear about what are the similarity and the differences between data. By using the transition, I hope they can have a better experience through out the whole reading process.
In the visualization, you can see the timeline visualization, the detail crime visualization, the suspect and the victim information. For further development, I will add a mouseover to show the description and the link to the article.
I delete the data about Atlanta because the Atlanta part is not well connected with the New York City report. As a student hope to study in New York one day, I am more interested in New York City.
I would like to make the Atanla part a side story because the Atlanta case is so special and partically it raising people's awareness about Asian American Hate Crime.
